                I have experience with JavaScript, C++, React, CSS, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. I graduated from the Soy Henry bootcamp that equips students with practical skills to build dynamic, scalable, and secure web applications using industry best practices and tools.

                <br />
                Right now, I am working on a personal project, an app that helps users manage their expenses easily. For this project, I am using Node.js and PostgreSQL for the backend, and I am using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend.
                <br />
                I am also studying for a University Degree in Programming at the National Technological University (UTN). This is helping me learn more about other languages like           C++ and Python.

                I am very passionate about creating innovative solutions that improve user experiences and solve real-life problems. I see myself as a curious, proactive, and collaborative person, always looking for new ways to learn and add value to the projects I work on
                <br />
                In addition to my technical skills, I believe that effective communication, teamwork, and adaptability are crucial in any project. I work to create a positive and teamwork-friendly environment because I believe it is important for getting good results
